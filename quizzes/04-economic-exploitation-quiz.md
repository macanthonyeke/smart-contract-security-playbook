# Economic Exploitation Quiz

1. How can rational users optimize behavior around YieldCore’s 1-day reward cap, and why might this weaken long-lock incentives?
2. What game-theoretic effects emerge from recycling early-unstake penalties into the shared `rewardPool`?
3. Why does first-come reward claiming create cohort-level fairness risk under constrained funding?
4. What griefing strategies become possible around pause/unpause events and owner reward funding cadence?
5. How would you model long-term rewardPool depletion risk under sustained high lock rates?
6. What redesign would guarantee emission solvency for accepted stakes rather than relying on discretionary future funding?
7. How could an epoch-based pro-rata system reduce claim-race asymmetry compared with the current model?
8. Propose an economically safer architecture for YieldCore and explain tradeoffs in gas, complexity, and UX.
